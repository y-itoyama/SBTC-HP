- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF851B), analogous to blue but distinctly different, for calls to action and important highlights.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) is used for body text paired with 'Playfair' (serif) which is used for headings to create an elegant and readable feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Modern, clean layout with clear sections for each key message. Use whitespace effectively to enhance readability and focus. A grid-based design ensures consistency and structure.
- Use a set of consistent icons to represent the SBTC benefits. Icons should be modern, professional, and related to sports, technology, and business.
- Subtle animations and transitions to guide users through the landing page. Use animations to highlight key elements and make the experience engaging without being distracting.
